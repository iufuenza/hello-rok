# README

Here you will find the code for my Hello Rok tutorials. How to get your Rails application running on Kubernetes.

The tutorial assumes you already have a Rails project running as a base. And from there, you can jump into the step that follow your needs. 

The code that you will find in master is a very basic Rails application.
